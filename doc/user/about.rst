Permutation tests and confidence sets
=====================================

Permutation tests and confidence sets for a variety of nonparametric
testing and estimation problems, for a variety of randomization designs.

* Stratified and unstratified tests ...
* Test statistics in each stratum ...
* Methods of combining tests across strata ...
* Nonparametric combinations of tests ...

Problems/Methods:
-----------------

1. The 2-sample problem
2. The *n*-sample problem
3. Tests for the slope in linear regression
4. Tests for quantiles
5. Tests of independence and association: runs tests, permutation association,  ...
6. Tests of exchangeability
7. Tests of symmetry: reflection, spherical, ...
8. Permutation ANOVA
9. Goodness of fit tests
10. ...

Confidence sets
---------------

1. Constant shifts
2. Proportional shifts
3. Monotone shifts
4. ...
